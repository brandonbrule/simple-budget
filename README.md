http://brandonbrule.github.io/simple-budget/

Simple budget calculator, estimates help give you a rough idea of how much you make, spend, and could save a year, month, week, day, second.

What you are paid per hour maybe different then actuality, this assumes you work a 7.5h day.

There's no real validation and it's not hooked up to any database, upon refresh your entry will be gone until you type in the numbers again. Don't worry, I know finances are confidential, nothing is stored.

Lend me your pull requests.

This has sat on my computer collecting dust for a while.  Want to help take it to the next level? Please do.
